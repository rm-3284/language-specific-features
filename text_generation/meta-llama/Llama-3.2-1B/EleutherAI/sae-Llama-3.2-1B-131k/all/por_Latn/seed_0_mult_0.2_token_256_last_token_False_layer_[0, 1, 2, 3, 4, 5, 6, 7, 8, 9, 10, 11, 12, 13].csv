Solution:Here's some sample python code which implements a function called check_extreme_online_shopping() that checks whether a shipping cost for an order from extreme online shopping site qualifies as ""extreme"" based on a set threshold value. The function uses an if...elif statement to evaluate different conditions and returns a message indicating whether the shipping cost qualifies as extreme or not.

Use if/else or switch/case statements to conditionally perform different actions based on the Consent. No need to create separate functions for each type of consent. Ensure your control flow is well-documented with comments explaining your approach.

Solution:Here is a possible implementation of this requirement in java:

1. First we define a class named ""Consent"" which will store information about each user's consent (true/false). 
2. Then we create another class called ""User"". This class has two fields: name and consent, where consent represents whether the user has given their explicit consent to be included in our analysis.
3. Next, we create a method called ""checkExtremeSocialMedia"" that takes a list of users as input and returns true if any one of them gave their explicit consent to participate in extreme social media marketing campaigns, otherwise returns false.
4. To implement the ""checkExtremeSocialMedia"" method, we can use an if statement inside a loop that iterates over all users. Inside this loop, we can check the value of each user's consent field and evaluate whether they gave their consent to participate in extreme social media marketing campaigns. If so"
